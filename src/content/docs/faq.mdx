# General

### Is IReader available on iOS?

Yes! IReader is available on both Android and Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux). Desktop versions include additional features like Text-to-Speech with Piper TTS.

### How do I request a new plugin?

Open an issue in the [`ireader-extensions`](https://github.com/IReaderorg/IReader-extensions/issues) repository. Share the website URL, preferred language, and any login or region requirements so plugin authors have the full context.

### Does the app collect analytics?

No. IReader ships without telemetry, trackers, or ads. Everything stays on your device unless you enable an external backup or sync integration.

### Do I need root access?

No. IReader runs on standard Android devices and tablets as long as they’re on Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or newer.
