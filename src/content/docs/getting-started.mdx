# Getting started with IReader

Thanks for downloading IReader! This guide walks through installing the Android app, adding your first source, and managing the reader experience.

## 1. Install the latest APK

1. Open the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/IReaderorg/IReader/releases) on your phone or desktop and pick the newest stable version.
2. Download the `app-release.apk` file listed under **Assets**.
3. When Android prompts for unknown sources permissions, allow it so the install can finish.
4. Once the installer completes, look for **IReader** in your app drawer and launch it.

> Tip: Curious about upcoming features? Grab the latest workflow build from the **Actions** tab and install that APK instead.

## 2. Add sources

IReader ships with a minimal catalogue so you can choose which sources to install.

1. On the IReader website, open the **Sources** link in the header. You can either tap **Add Repository in IReader** (to send it straight to the app) or copy the repository URL for later.
2. On your device, open IReader, head to **Sources**, and tap **Add repository** if you copied the URL. Paste the link and confirm.
3. After the repository syncs, install the sources you want by tapping **Install**.
4. Access installed sources from the **Browse** tab. Each source provides its own filters and language settings.

Need a plugin that’s missing? Create a request in the [`ireader-extensions` repository](https://github.com/IReaderorg/IReader-extensions/issues).

## 3. Build your library

1. Tap a novel from a source, then press **Add to library**.
2. Chapters can be downloaded in bulk or on demand. Long-press to multi-select, then choose **Download**.
3. Organize with categories like _Ongoing_, _Completed_, or custom tags.
4. Enable library updates to keep track of new chapters across all sources.

## 4. Customize the reader

- Switch between built-in reader themes or design your own color palette.
- Adjust font family, text size, and line height per source or globally.
- Toggle immersive mode, scroll direction, and reading progress indicators.
- Sync reading positions to the cloud with your preferred backup solution.
- Apply custom CSS or JS scripts when you need deeper control over the reading view.

## 5. Stay in sync

- **Backups**: Export your library, categories, and history from **Settings → Backup & Restore**.
- **Discord**: Join the [IReader community](https://discord.gg/HBU6zD8c5v) for support, news, and source updates.
- **GitHub**: Star the repository, follow the roadmap, and contribute fixes or translations.

You’re all set—happy reading!
